        <h1>Quotail Terms of Service</h1>
        <h3>I. Introduction</h3>
        <p>Quotail LLC (referred to as “Quotail” or “We”) is an options research application (referred to as “Application” or “Service”) that provides a subscription service for monitoring and analyzing options time and sales data, along with various derived and proprietary metrics. The Service is provided as a monthly subscription to its users via a web interface.</p>
        <h3>II. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
        <p>By checking the box below, you agree to the terms of the service set forth below. Your use of the Application is a binding agreement to follow these Terms of Service, and if you do not agree with any terms, DO NOT use the Application.</p>
        <h3>III. Changes to Terms of Service</h3>
        <p>Quotail may change Terms of Service at any time, without notice. These changes will be reflected in the Terms of Service here, and they will also be available within the Application’s Settings page, under “Terms of Service”. Any changes will be effective immediately, and your continued use of the Application constitutes an agreement to the new Terms of Service. If you disagree with the changes made to Terms of Service, you can cancel your membership or contact us at team@quotail.co.</p>
        <h3>IV.Product & Services</h3>
        <h4>A. Use of Cookies</h4>
        <p>As part of Quotail’s efforts to understand user experience and usage behavior, we will attempt to place a cookie in your browser. The information stored in the cookie will not be shared with any external parties, and we will not attempt to send targeted advertisements based on the cookie.</p>
        <h4>B. Communication and Notices</h4>
        <p>From time to time, we will communicate with users about important developments, changes to membership policies, information about your account, and various marketing material with the purpose of keeping users apprised of Quotail and the Application. By registering, you agree to be sent emails.
        WHEN REGISTERING, YOU MUST USE A VALID EMAIL THAT YOU CHECK FREQUENTLY. Furthermore, you agree that all information provided to Quotail as part of registration is accurate and up to date. Quotail will require you to activate your account through a link sent to the email used for registration. You may change the email listed on the account within the settings page of the Application.</p>
        <h4>C. User Account</h4>
        <p>The account created by the user can only be used by the person whose name and email is on the account. YOU AGREE NOT TO SHARE ACCESS TO THIS ACCOUNT WITH ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL OR INSTITUTION, OR TO REDISTRIBUTE THE CONTENT THEREIN. Quotail reserves the right to suspend your account, without refund, if we detect multiple people using the same account. Each user creates their own username and password and it is the user’s responsibility to keep these secure. Quotail is not liable for any irresponsible actions of the user.</p>
        <h4>D. User Privacy and Security</h4>
        <p>User privacy is very serious at Quotail. We will not share any of your personal or identifiable information with anybody else and promise to share and transmit them in a reasonably secure manner, as guided by Internet security standards. We will do our best to ensure the integrity of all data stored and transmitted by the Application. We do not store passwords in plain text, and all data is transmitted securely via HTTPS protocol.</p>
        <h3>V. Warranty</h3>
        <p>While Quotail strives for data accuracy, completeness, and timeliness, we make no guarantees. THE CONTENT AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, TIMELINESS, OR SUITABILITY FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>
        <h3> VI. Liabilities and Indemnity </h3>
        <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL QUOTAIL, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, CONTENT SUPPLIERS, AS WELL THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS BE LIABLE TOWARD YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS PROFIT OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) ARISING FROM, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY DELAYS, INACCURACIES, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, BREACH OF SECURITY, VIRUSES, OR INTERRUPTION OR TERMINATION OF SERVICE FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER.</p>
        <p>Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE FULL LIABILITY OF QUOTAIL, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, CONTENT SUPPLIERS, AS WELL THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS EXCEED THE AMOUNT THAT YOU HAVE PAID FOR THE SPECIFIC SERVICE FROM QUOTAIL THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS CLAIM.</p>
        <h3>VII. Copyright and Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>All content displayed on the site, including, but not limited to, graphs, visualizations, images, logos, data, and code, is the sole property of Quotail and is protected by copyright and intellectual property laws. You agree not to reproduce, redistribute, publish, or in any way disseminate any content without the written consent of Quotail.</p>
        <h3>VIII. Use of Bots</h3>
        <p>All data and content available via the Application are for display purposes only. You agree not to download, export, scrape, or programmatically access the Application or its content in any way. We enforce strict rate limiting to prevent the use of bots, and if we notice any abuse of the application, whether programmatic or not, we reserve the right to terminate the subscription without refund.</p>
        <h3>IX. Quotail Fees and Subscription </h3>
        <h4>A. Beta Users Membership</h4>
        <p>Quotail offers a free membership for users who we have designated as early users of the Quotail product. Quotail reserves the right to end this free membership at any time.</p>
        <h4>B. Trial Membership</h4>
        <p>Quotail may provide a free trial for new users. This trial is only available to new users, and if we detect the same person creating multiple accounts, we reserve the right to ban the IP address of the offender. Quotail reserves the right to change the length and availability of a trial offer without notice.</p>
        <h4>C. Monthly Membership</h4>
        <p>After the Beta and Trial periods - whichever comes last - Quotail LLC charges users a monthly fee for the use of its Quotail product. This fee will be clearly stated in the “Settings” page of the Application. By entering your payment information, you authorize Quotail to charge a monthly membership fee at the prescribed rate. You will be billed every month on the day that you first registered for our paid services.</p>
        <p>Quotail reserves the right to change this fee at any time. We will provide an advance notice, through the registered email, of at least thirty days before enacting any changes in fees, and will allow users to cancel their membership before the new rate takes place.</p>
        <h4>D. Cancellation Policy</h4>
        <p>Users of the Application have the right to cancel their membership at any time without notice. This can be done by visiting the “Settings” page on the Application and clicking on the cancellation button within the Subscription section. Upon cancellation, you will receive no further billings and continue to have access to the Application for the duration of your billing cycle. After the end of your billing cycle, you will automatically be redirected to the settings page when attempting to log-in to the Application. From there, you can reactivate your membership if you would like to continue using the Application.</p>
        <h3>X. Advice</h3>
        <p>The purpose of the Application and its content is to inform users of activity in the options market. Quotail is not a registered investment advisor or broker-dealer and hence nothing on the Application or within any content distributed by Quotail shall be interpreted as a recommendation, advice, or endorsement in any way of any financial instrument. Trading options is inherently risky, and we make no guarantees of any profit or loss. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance.</p>
        <h3>XI. Arbitration and Jurisdiction</h3>
        <p>Any claim arising our of or related to the Terms of Service, or breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in the State of Connecticut. The prevailing party in any such arbitration shall be entitled to an award of its costs and fees. “Costs and fees” shall mean  all reasonable pre-award expenses of the arbitration, including the arbitrator's fees, administrative fees, travel expenses, out-of-pocket expenses such as copying and telephone, court costs, witness fees and reasonable attorneys' fees. The arbitrator shall not be empowered to render an award containing punitive damages. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. </p>
